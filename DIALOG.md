## Old Hag in Ogbam forest
Come close princess, I'll tell you a great secret!
Hear me whisper, trust no one with hair... don't even trust me!
I've stolen one of your lives!

## Thirsty woman
Young princess, please attend me. A traveller of kind intentions has found me at last!
I am collapsed with thirst and dryness.

Bless you princess, you have saved the life of a weary old woman, I offer you these treasures.

## 1 screen west of vision henge with empty water bottle
I am shermak your guide, I have known you since you were a child. You were given a difficult challenge.
You will have to go far and overcome great danger. Stay calm and use your knowledge and strength to defeat your enemies.
Remember what you learn along the way and persevere. Go now to the one who has a bed but never sleeps, 
where by its side the red willow weeps, and to its mouth that never speaks.

## Hungry woman
Oh fair princess, pity a suffering creature, exiled from Great Wimbich in the north, I ask only enough for a single meal for my children
who hunger and are chilled by the wind.

You will be blessed a thousands times, a thousand fair princess.

## Ogbam forest shop
Come here bright young lady, I have a wonderful bargin for you. Take some Ogbam herb for free, then look around, there's plenty to buy!

That was a wise purchase young princess

## Moblin's head Inn

### Barman
Welcome to the Moblin's head inn my princess, you look dry. Have a cup of Andor's cider on the house.

I have a spell of Calm to sell, but it will cost you 100 rupees.

That is wise beyond your years, the spell of Calm will help you when you need it most, use it well and look out for yourself
on the lonely plain of Andor.

### Woman
You look like an honest maid, sit a moment. It is said those who go deep into the earth learn to overcome the sins of greed. That may be true,
but I do know this: a candle and a silver key can bring you bliss. Hurry on now lass, time's a wastin'.

### Man with dagger
Why spend a whole lifetime being defeated like me? Get it over with quick, go home, give up.
You're patient, I can see you're not one to surrender. Alright, take this dagger from me, it may do you more service than it ever did me.

### Exhausted guy
I'm so exhaused from my travels, if only I'd known to cross the chasm rift with the ladder, it would've saved me months.

## Earth Shrine

### Shurmak
Beware the evils of greed, act quickly, think on your feet and you will be rewarded.

### Lort 1
Do not come in here, you are not wanted, I am Lort and this is my shrine, all mine.

Hey-de-hee, who thee be, you're no friend to us down here.
I've failed in my mission. Lort this enemy is coming!

Who who, Oh who, what do we have here, a human person's coming close, why, what a great event, whoa, who, who

### Blue sheepman
Ugh. I thought I was alone here. Lort! An enemy is in your cave.
Lort I couldn't stop her, get ready to fight!

### Lort 2
I said this is my cave, mine. This is the shrine of rock and I am Lort! Go away, take nothing, it's all mine.

### Yellow sheepman
Hey who goes there, aren't you an enemy of my boss Lort? You can't come in here.
Hey Lort, watch out. She's coming!

### Lort 3 (boss fight)
You've been taking my things. Put them back, don't touch anything, those are all my gems.

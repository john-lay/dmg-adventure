## Old Hag in Ogbam forest
Come close princess, I'll tell you a great secret!
Hear me whisper, trust no one with hair... don't even trust me!
I've stolen one of your lives!

## Thirsty woman
Young princess, please attend me. A traveller of kind intentions has found me at last!
I am collapsed with thirst and dryness.

Bless you princess, you have saved the life of a weary old woman, I offer you these treasures.

## 1 screen west of vision henge with empty water bottle
I am shermak your guide, I have known you since you were a child. You were given a difficult challenge.
You will have to go far and overcome great danger. Stay calm and use your knowledge and strength to defeat your enemies.
Remember what you learn along the way and persevere. Go now to the one who has a bed but never sleeps, 
where by its side the red willow weeps, and to its mouth that never speaks.

## Hungry woman
Oh fair princess, pity a suffering creature, exiled from Great Wimbich in the north, I ask only enough for a single meal for my children
who hunger and are chilled by the wind.

You will be blessed a thousands times, a thousand fair princess.

## Ogbam forest shop
Come here bright young lady, I have a wonderful bargin for you. Take some Ogbam herb for free, then look around, there's plenty to buy!

That was a wise purchase young princess
